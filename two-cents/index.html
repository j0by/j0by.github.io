Demonstrations and actual activity are only for, how do I put this delicately? the lesser abled. Smart ones always prefer debate and  (in)effective policy changes to action. As, I belong to the latter, I naturally chose policy change as my weapon. I think the biggest problem that women face today in this country is false-hope. Let's take the preamble to the constitution, for example. It starts like this</p> <blockquote><p>We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic and to secure to all its citizens ..</p></blockquote> <p>The framers of the constitution clearly overlooked one thing. The inability of women to read between the lines. If you read between the lines, the preamble clearly states that,</p> <blockquote><p>We, the men of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic and to secure to all its male citizens ..</p></blockquote> <p>You cannot blame women's organisations who draw inspiration from the constitution and ask for equal rights. The fault lies with us men and it is high time that we step up, right the wrong and state clearly that equality is not on the table. It never was. We should actually draw inspiration from the American constitution, which clearly addresses this issue. Apparently there was an addendum which clearly stated that the men in <em>All men are created equal</em>, only meant rich white men. The original document was destroyed, but they drew inspiration from the Indian sages and passed down the contents of the addendum from one generation to another by word of mouth. It was amended many times, and I think the latest version says, the men in <em>All men are created equal</em> refer to rich white men, rich black men who support (read give money to) the GOP and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Coming back to India, I think it is totally unfair on the part of women's rights groups to claim that women don't have any rights in the country. They do have rights that are enforceable. The right to be sold as a commodity in the name of marriage, the right to change their name to reflect transference of ownership, etc are few that come to my mind. They are enforceable only via the institution of patriarchy, but everyone knows that in a court of law, patriarchy will trump even the constitution. So, I really don't know what they are crying about.</p> <p>Also, rights are not free. Along with being granted rights, you also have to shoulder some responsibility. And the only responsibility that women have is to uphold Indian culture. But, men in this country are so liberal that, they allow even women who do not shoulder this responsibility to exercise their rights (right to be sold and right of name change).</p> <p>So, as you can see clearly what we need to do is to set the expectation correctly and all our problems will vanish. Also, you cannot expect all men to be liberal. Some will not like the fact that women don't  do justice to their one responsibility. This will lead to incidents like Nirbhaya. So, women should start being responsible and stop giving foreign governments the opportunity to defame India. If she had just stuck to her responsibility the cause to film the documentary would not have existed. I haven't watched the documentary because I am a law abiding citizen. But I am a devoted follower of Lord Aamir Khan and he has clearly taught us that it is one's right to take offense at the contents of a video one hasn't watched. So I am taking offense at the contents of the documentary, even though I haven't watched it.</p> <p>PS: If someone from the government is reading this, I am waiting for you guys to declare <em>being offended</em> a national sport. In anticipation, I have already started preparations for landing a place in the national team. I currently specialise in being offended at stuff I don't understand. Also, the contents of this article are not original thoughts of the author and he, therefore, cannot be held accountable for the content. I only googled women's rights and wrote an article with stuff I nicked from others to show that I care about women's rights. It seemed the in thing to do.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
