This was one of the reasons that contributed to the housing bubble. An asset bubble is basically a situation where the price of the asset becomes artificially inflated. So the asset will be priced more than its real value. In a housing bubble, house prices will become artificially inflated. Asset bubbles work based on something known as the greater fool theory. It basically says that, I am willing to buy the asset at a higher price today, because I am sure that I will be able to find a greater fool (than me) in future, who will buy it from me at an even higher price. Easy access to mortgage basically fueled people to invest in real estate. But, mortgages in fact became costlier. Lenders started putting more and more people in sub-prime category as it brought them more fees. And the bubble that resulted led to more than doubling of home prices over a 10 year period.</p> <p>The problem with all bubbles is that they will burst sometime or the other. And the bursting of the housing bubble in the US directly led to the Financial Crisis. Let me give you an example to illustrate. Assume a house was worth 100,000 during the bubble. You could get a mortgage for up to 70% of the value of the house. So you got a mortgage for 70,000. When the bubble burst, the value of your house dipped down to 50,000. Now a lot of people bought two and three houses as investments. So when the bubble burst, they just defaulted on the mortgages as there was no point in paying back a mortgage of 70,000 on a house that was worth only 50,000. These mortgage defaults led to the failing of CDOs and in turn led to the crisis.</p> <p>Before I end I want to talk about the real estate market in India. We have a real estate bubble in India also. But people say because India is a developing country because the demand for real estate is really high, there won't be any problem. But I beg to differ. Yes, that is my opinion, but I want to highlight a few facts. Real Estate prices are rising at a very high rate, but real income in India is not rising that fast. You might think how is that possible, as you and your friends have gotten good jobs after college. But this is valid only for something like the top 10% of the population at the maximum. Rest of them haven't seen any real appreciation in wages. Majority of them will be more than happy to find part-time work. This situation can lead to two realistic outcomes:</p> <ol><li><p>The people in the lower wage category buy real estate. This will be possible only if the borrowing standards become lax. Lax borrowing standards (remember laxer standards mean mortgage will become costlier and this will kind of aggravate things) for a huge section of the population will inevitably lead to defaults and a situation similar to what happened in US.</p></li> <li><p>Only people with the means to buy real estate actually buy them. This would mean that all that real estate is technically being brought or exchanged between the top 10% of the population. This would mean that it is a bubble and someone at some point is going to say no to the exorbitant prices. And when bubbles burst, it won't be a gradual decline in prices. It will be more like falling off a cliff.</p></li></ol> <p>But, like I said it really is up to you to decide.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
