There is no reason why these should stop after retirement. After all the years of hard work, money should not be the concern for you to decide how you would spend your retirement. A smart way to ensure regular income stream post retirement is buying an Immediate Annuity.</p></blockquote> <p>These are lines from the brochure of a big Insurance firm, showcasing annuity products. The advertisement promises a minimum return in the region of <code>8%</code>. Hmm...that seems decent. So, for an annuity with an annual payment of <code>10,000</code>, with a return of <code>8%</code>, you will need to pay <code>1,25,000</code> now. For, the annuity formula see <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/101503.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>. So, if the bank invests your money at <code>8%</code>, they will not get any return, right?</p> <p>Not quite. You see, the annuity payment above assumes you will live till infinity. But let's be realistic. Let's assume you will receive the payments for <code>70 years</code>. Ok, that might not exactly be realistic, but let's assume that. The catch here is that you will still have to pay assuming you live till infinity. But the company will have to pay you for only <code>70 years</code>. So, to pay you <code>10,000</code> per year, based on the annuity formula, they will need to invest <code>1,24,428</code>. They will make a profit of <code>0.45%</code>. Hmm, so they are ready to make almost no profits just to ensure that you can have a steady income.</p> <p>All this would have been okay in a world with no inflation. These annuities are not inflation adjusted. So, you are going to receive only <code>10,000</code>, 50 years down the line and it won't be worth what it is now because of inflation. Let us assume an inflation rate of <code>5%</code>, considering a country like India. With the inflation factored in the company would only need to invest <code>74,616</code> to keep paying you <code>10,000</code> for 70 years. That is equivalent to a profit of <code>40.3%</code>.</p> <p>The company has better access to the market than any individual. So it is only reasonable to assume that they can invest your money at <code>10%</code>. In that case, the company needs to invest only <code>64,513</code>, which amounts to a profit of <code>48.3%</code>. Imagine that! They make a profit of close to <code>50%</code> on a simple investment product like an annuity.</p> <p>So, by <em>investing</em> you are giving them <code>~50%</code> of your savings for no reason. In plain English, it is called  <em>extortion</em>. But apparently in Financial lingo it's called <em>retirement planning</em>.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
