All four are businessmen. Mr. D's business is doing pretty well and he is very rich. Mr. R and Mr. G aren't so fortunate. Their businesses aren't in great shape, but they make enough to get by. Mr. EB, well his business is basically conning people. The year is 2008. Mr. EB has just completed a job (con-job) that has made him really rich. Back in 2002, Mr. D, Mr. R and Mr. G entered into an agreement whereby Mr. D helped Mr. R and Mr. G get loans from the local casino. The place where they live in has no banks, so everyone there takes loans from the local casino. And the loans the casino give are all floating rate loans. Back to the present (2008), the Global financial crisis has affected the town where our characters live. Business is bad. But Mr. R, and Mr. G make enough to pay back their loans. They are currently paying an interest of 4%. But if by some misfortune, the floating rates go above 5% they will default on their loans. A year passes by. Mr. EB had been partying hard with his hard earned con-money. But things have become boring again. The cocaine and trophy wives can't give him the same kick that conning people do. So he decides to get back to business. But alas, due to the crisis, everyone is more watchful of their money. Pulling off a con will be very hard. So he settles for gambling instead. After doing some research, he goes to the local casino and makes two bets. The first bet is that if Mr. G becomes bankrupt, he will earn 10 million. The second bet is that if Mr. R goes bankrupt then he will earn 50 million. Now, Mr. EB does not believe in luck. He knows what he has to do. Mr. EB, being a financial whiz, knows that if he can get the floating rate above 5%, he can get his money. He starts by spreading rumours that Mr. G's business is doing very bad and he doesn't have the money to repay the loan. People start believing, Mr. EB (he's the financial whiz, duh!). The casino also starts to panic. He wants to get maximum money out before Mr. G goes bankrupt. So he starts increasing the rates. (Idiot casino, always works on sentiments). In a year's time, the rates cross 5% and voila, Mr. G goes bankrupt. Mr. EB is elated. He didn't think it was so easy. Next target, Mr. R. Mr. EB, spreads new rumours that, since Mr. G, knew Mr. R, Mr. R will also go bankrupt. Stupid casino believes that also. He starts increasing the rates for Mr. R. Mr. EB's plan is working. Ah, not so fast Mr. EB. Mr. D has other plans. He was the one who helped R and G get the loans. So, he feels that it is in his best interest, to loan money to Mr. G to repay his loan. How very benevolent of him. Well, not quite. In return, he makes Mr. G his slave. Our stupid casino stops panicking. Mr. R is safe for now. But Mr. EB, hasn't given up. He waits patiently. It's October, 2014 now. The original bet that Mr. EB made at the casino is still valid. The time is now ripe to go after Mr. R, feels Mr. EB. He starts spreading false rumours about Mr. R again.</p> <p>Nice story, eh? Imagine if this happened in the real world.</p> <p><em>Disclaimer</em>: All the character's in this story are fictional. Any of the following resemblances:  Mr. D (Deutsche) to Germany, Mr. R (Roma) to Italy, Mr. G (Greek) to Greece, Mr. EB (Evil Banker) to banks in general and Casino to capital markets, that you might feel are purely coincidental.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
