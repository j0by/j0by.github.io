Don't bother figuring out what that means. Just read it anyway, now that you are here.</p> <p>In school, all of us were taught that hydrogen sulphide smells like rotten eggs. And most of us have experienced the same. But really, is that correct? The question we should all be asking is, <code>Why do rotten eggs smell of hydrogen sulphide?</code>. Hydrogen sulphide actually smells of, well, er hydrogen sulphide. And when eggs turn rotten, it produces hydrogen sulphide.</p> <p>Why the chemistry lesson you ask? What I just described is something we can call attribution error. You are exposed to rotten eggs before you come to know about hydrogen sulphide. So, you attribute the smell of hydrogen sulphide to rotten eggs while in truth, hydrogen sulphide just smells of itself.</p> <p>The point I wanted to make was that patriarchy has been a social evil for a long time. It has become so much ingrained in our fabric that we don't tend to realise that most of our actions are patriarchal. Let's do a little <em>scientific study</em> shall we?</p> <p>All of us have come across the <em>joke</em>, where promiscuity of women are frowned upon, - A key that can open many locks is called a master key, but a lock that can be opened by many keys is a shitty lock. Ah, how very convenient right? We have a real-world parallel that clearly says that women shouldn't be sluts. That's it end of story. Thanks for reading, oh wait, is a lock a natural thing or a man-made tool? Ah, you buy locks from a shop. So it is designed and made my a human being.</p> <p>Locksmiths, when locks came into being, were exclusively men. That wasn't because patriarchy was prevalent then. Society then was so liberal, that the only job they wanted women to undertake was having sex. I am talking about rich women, of course. Being a middle-class Malayali boy, I don't even care about poor men, then how can you expect me to care about poor women? hmm...do  you address them as she or it?. Coming back to locksmiths, were they mere mortals who could be influenced by the prevalent social conditions, or were they all replica of Thor, you know blonde god with the hammer who saves the damsel in distress and also the world. Hmm....they couldn't have all been Thors, otherwise I would be six feet tall, with blonde hair and blue eyes. A Nazi would have had an orgasm just hearing that description. Ha, but Hitler was a short stocky guy with black hair, we will have the last laugh, haha.</p> <p>So, could it be that it was one of the mere mortal locksmiths, who actually designed the lock. And could it be that he was influenced by medieval (or whichever time period locks were invented) liberalism, also know as patriarchy. So, locks are the way they are because of patriarchy. Imagine that. What are the chances that this could have happened? Let's see 100%, ya that's right 100%. And here we thought, patriarchy was a conspiracy made up by feminists and men who cross dress.</p> <p>Just like our chemistry lesson, locks are the way they are because of patriarchy. So, you can't use an example of a lock and key, to invent a joke to support your point of view on how women should behave. Or for that matter most stuff men have invented. And men have invented most of the stuff because they never let women do any such interesting stuff. The world we live in might have been a so much better a place if we hadn't prevented half the world's population from using their brains. So patriarchy is not just stupid, but it might well have prevented our development.</p> <p>Now you might think, some of the thoughts I have expressed here might have been influenced by a political thought named for a commonly used direction (which is not right). For those people - <em>Hail Hitler!</em> There, I have expressed allegiance to the far right. That should get me, on an average, to the centre of the political spectrum. Who doesn't like things to be balanced, right?</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
