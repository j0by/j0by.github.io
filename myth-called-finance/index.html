But I beg to differ. They do have a lot in common. For one, both have their own tricks that are meant to fool you. Secondly, hmm well can't think of anything now, but it seemed such a good line that I didn't want to change it.</p> <p>This is actually my first attempt at a blog. I basically want to dispel the myth that finance is something that is beyond the understanding of the common man. So am I an expert in Finance? Well no, not really. But I did my PGDM (Finance) from IIM Kozhikode. So I guess I am reasonably qualified to talk about this topic. But as you will see, it just requires common sense to understand.</p> <p>Let's start with something simple. One thing that finance guys use to confuse people is what I would like to call fin-speak. They will give alternate meanings to English words and use these in normal conversation. So the listener, unless he knows these fin-meanings, will not be able to make head or tail of it. My favourite words from this vocabulary are <em>long</em> and <em>short</em>.</p> <p>Long in English means <em>measuring a great distance from end to end/ lasting or taking a great amount of time</em>. Short means <em>measuring a small distance from end to end/ lasting or taking a small amount of time</em>. But in fin-speak, Long means <em>to buy</em> and short means <em>to sell</em>.</p> <p>Let's look at a typical scenario:<br>
Business News Anchor: Mr. X what is your view on stock ABC ?<br>
X: I will go long on it as the earnings are in sync with market expectations.</p> <p>What X actually means is I want the people who are watching this to buy ABC. What he doesn't tell you is his company owns quite a lot of stocks of ABC and nobody is buying them. He is not getting a bonus unless someone buys them. So he is going to use his <em>expertise</em> (that last part - earnings are in sync with market expectations, is supposed to show his expertise), to advise you to buy a stock no one wants.</p> <p>Ok, got carried away a bit but what I just described is closer to the truth than you think. This was kind of an introduction to what I will be writing about. I just want to highlight one fact - you cannot make easy money. The only people who make them are the finance professionals (by selling you things you don't want). And this post might not be very structured but it's definitely more structured than the thought process behind a <em>structured finance</em> product.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
