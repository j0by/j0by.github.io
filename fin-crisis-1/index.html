A real engineer build bridges. A financial engineer build dreams. And, you know, when these dreams turn out to nightmares, other people pay for it</p></blockquote> <p><em>Andrew Sheng</em>, Chief Adviser, China Banking Regulatory Commission.</p> <p>These few sentences neatly sums up the Financial Crisis of 2008. The crisis was the nightmare. The dreams were the <em>instruments</em>, which the banks created, that caused the crisis. The analysts at the banks were handsomely rewarded for creating and trading in these <em>instruments</em>.And common people, as usual, paid the price.</p> <p>What caused the crisis of 2008? Sub-prime mortgage lending and securitization. Someone who is not from the financial industry, will never be able to understand what these are. Even if you look up Wikipedia, or any other site for definitions they will define it using 20 or so other terms, which again you won't be knowing. So it's kind of a futile exercise. But let me try to explain them in plain language.</p> <p>Normally when you take a loan, only two parties are involved - you and the bank. The bank will give you a loan and charge you a rate of interest, based on your ability to pay them back. But what happens in securitization is the bank will sell your loan to an investment bank. So now you owe the money to the investment bank. The bank from which you took the loan will simply act as an intermediary. They will pass on the payments you make to the investment bank. But so far things have remained simple. How can investments banks sell something so simple as a loan?</p> <p>Enter, <em>financial innovation</em>. The investment banks will combine a lot of loans and create a collateralized debt obligation (CDO). I actually think, it is magic that helps them make the transformation, because nothing logical can actually explain the transformation. Traditionally, giving someone a loan is a risky business. So giving say five loans is kind of riskier. But when an investment bank combines many loans and makes a collateralized debt obligation, the thing magically(?) becomes less risky. It suddenly becomes the best possible investment (with a AAA rating, rating given to the safest instruments). So investors were basically giving their money to investment banks so that they could loan it out to people. If the person who took the loan doesn't pay back, the investors will lose their money. Ah, but won't the investment banks lose money?</p> <p>No. There was once a law called the Glass-Steagall Act. One of its provisions was that if you create an investment vehicle, you cannot take leverage in a ratio greater than 2:1 (or 3:1 or some small number). What this means is that if you ask someone to invest money in something, you will have to put in 33% of the money. Say, you have an investment scheme that has a total value of 3 million. You will have to put up minimum 1 million and other people can invest the rest of the money only (so, maximum 2 million). So if Glass-Steagall was valid, and investment banks had floated CDOs, they would lose money if the person who took the loan didn't pay up. Ah, but investment banks have a lot of lobbying power. They used their lobbying power to pass a law (Gramm- Leach- Bliley Act, aptly named the Financial Services Modernization Act) which overturned this provision of Glass-Steagall. Now they could borrow in ratios like 33:1 and 66: 1. But still wouldn't they lose that 1/34th or 1/67th part?</p> <p>Again, No. You see they charge fees for CDOs. This fees will easily cover, the 1/34th or 1/67th part they had invested. So they didn't care if the person to whom they gave the loan defaulted. But things don't end there either. They wanted to maximise their fees. That is where the sub-prime mortgage lending comes in. Sub-prime are those basically those people who don't have the ability to pay back their loan. And mortgage loans are loans against a house or property. If a person who is rated sub-prime gets a loan, he will be charged a high rate of interest (more than normal). The investment banks charged the maximum fees for CDOs made from sub-prime mortgage loans. The reasoning behind that was if a sub-prime person actually paid back, then the return was higher because the interest on the loan was higher. Very smart, I mean what was the problem in assuming that a person who did not have the means to pay back his loan, will pay you back.</p> <p>The investment banks promoted subprime lending as they brought in maximum fees. The normal banks also promoted those as they wanted to sell of their loans to investment banks (and they only wanted subprime loans). But after sometime, in 2008, the subprime borrowers, surprise, surprise, defaulted on their loans. Now who could have predicted that happening? It was, as most banks say now, a black swan event. A freak event which no one could predict. How can you blame them for black swan events?</p> <p>What I described here is a major part of what contributed to the crisis. But an explanation won't be complete without examining related events like the housing bubble. I will write about them in my next post.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
