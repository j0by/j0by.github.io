The markets reacted negatively to this news. Some argued that the Fed must continue with the program. Others said that it was the right time to withdraw it. News channels the world over sought expert opinion of <em>qualified</em> economists as to how a world without quantitative easing will look like. So what is this quantitative easing?</p> <p>Basically, quantitative easing is a way of printing money. But then why don't they just call it that? Frankly, I think it's because using the term quantitative easing makes them sound more intelligent. I mean honestly, you are in a recession and the head of your central bank says in the press conference, <em>As part of the measures to tide over the recession, we are printing more money</em> and you will be like <em>Dude, what?</em> But if he comes on the air and says, <em>We are implementing quantitative easing</em>, you are more likely to feel reassured, even though you have no clue what he meant.</p> <p>Now economists might argue that during quantitative easing, the central bank will <em>purchase</em> securities(like treasury bonds) from the banks and give them money in return. Not really. Firstly, during the recent quantitative easing, what the Fed purchased were securities that had no value (CDOs and other securitized instruments which had zero value after the financial crisis). If you give money to someone and in return get something that has no value, it is as good as giving them free money. Secondly, let us assume that the securities that the Fed purchased were actually government bonds. The Fed issues government bonds. The banks buy them. Then the Fed buys them back at a higher rate. That is again like giving them free money. So, quantitative easing is just a fancy name for printing money.</p> <p>So did printing money actually help? Well it did help the money supply if you define money supply as bonuses to bank employees. According to market economics, if you give money to banks, they will make it available to the general public in the form of more loans and so people will have more cash to work with and the economy can grow. But as usual this theory seems to underestimate one factor, the people who work in financial institutions, in particular, their greed. You see after the financial crisis, a lot of banks were broke and they didn't have money to pay bonuses. So they used a part of this money on bonuses and the rest, on other investments (read new legal ways to fool people and make money) which will guarantee them future bonuses.</p> <p>And market economists will keep coming up with such <em>wonderful</em> theories, because it's about finding reasons to give powerful interests what they want (I <em>borrowed</em> that last sentence from Paul Krugman's article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/opinion/paul-krugman-charlatans-cranks-and-kansas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlatans, Cranks and Kansas<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.
