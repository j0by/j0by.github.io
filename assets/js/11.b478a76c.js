This was one of the reasons that contributed to the housing bubble. An asset bubble is basically a situation where the price of the asset becomes artificially inflated. So the asset will be priced more than its real value. In a housing bubble, house prices will become artificially inflated. Asset bubbles work based on something known as the greater fool theory. It basically says that, I am willing to buy the asset at a higher price today, because I am sure that I will be able to find a greater fool (than me) in future, who will buy it from me at an even higher price. Easy access to mortgage basically fueled people to invest in real estate. But, mortgages in fact became costlier. Lenders started putting more and more people in sub-prime category as it brought them more fees.

And the bursting of the housing bubble in the US directly led to the Financial Crisis. Let me give you an example to illustrate. Assume a house was worth 100,000 during the bubble. You could get a mortgage for up to 70% of the value of the house. So you got a mortgage for 70,000. When the bubble burst, the value of your house dipped down to 50,000. Now a lot of people bought two and three houses as investments. So when the bubble burst, they just defaulted on the mortgages as there was no point in paying back a mortgage of 70,000 on a house that was worth only 50,000. These mortgage defaults led to the failing of CDOs and in turn led to the crisis.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Before I end I want to talk about the real estate market in India.

Yes, that is my opinion, but I want to highlight a few facts. Real Estate prices are rising at a very high rate, but real income in India is not rising that fast. You might think how is that possible, as you and your friends have gotten good jobs after college. But this is valid only for something like the top 10% of the population at the maximum.
