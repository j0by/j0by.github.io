It is the Swedish Central Bank (Sveriges Riksbank) that administers it and not the Nobel Foundation. And it is technically not a prize for Economics. It is awarded only to market economists.

The Nobel Prize is awarded to people who have significantly contributed to cultural and/or scientific advances. So the whole idea is to create the façade that economics is a science. If you can put it on the same pedestal as a science like physics or chemistry, it becomes harder for common people to question it. To question a theory from physics you actually need to know about the theory. If you think that economics is a science then you will feel that you need to know more about it to question it, even though the economic theory might sound like bullshit to you (bullshit, not gibberish). And even if you learn those, most of them won’t make sense as they are mostly made up stuff. Because no economic theory has ever been able to correctly predict a particular outcome every time with the same accuracy. But real science can. Let’s take the case of relativity from physics. Most of you might think the effects of relativity can only be evident in some controlled experiment in a laboratory designed specifically for this purpose. Actually no. If you do not factor in relativity, any GPS you use will be able to predict your location to an accuracy of 52 kilometres only! You can say goodbye to navigating with Google maps. GPS’s work because light behaves the way Einstein predicted it would every single time. But no economist will be able to do something like that. And frankly I believe it’s a disgrace to real sciences that we keep referring to the economics prize as the Nobel Prize.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
