The investment banks will combine a lot of loans and create a collateralized debt obligation (CDO). I actually think, it is magic that helps them make the transformation, because nothing logical can actually explain the transformation. Traditionally, giving someone a loan is a risky business. So giving say five loans is kind of riskier. But when an investment bank combines many loans and makes a collateralized debt obligation, the thing magically(?) becomes less risky. It suddenly becomes the best possible investment (with a AAA rating, rating given to the safest instruments).

One of its provisions was that if you create an investment vehicle, you cannot take leverage in a ratio greater than 2:1 (or 3:1 or some small number). What this means is that if you ask someone to invest money in something, you will have to put in 33% of the money. Say, you have an investment scheme that has a total value of 3 million. You will have to put up minimum 1 million and other people can invest the rest of the money only (so, maximum 2 million). So if Glass-Steagall was valid, and investment banks had floated CDOs, they would lose money if the person who took the loan didn't pay up. Ah, but investment banks have a lot of lobbying power. They used their lobbying power to pass a law (Gramm- Leach- Bliley Act, aptly named the Financial Services Modernization Act) which overturned this provision of Glass-Steagall.

This fees will easily cover, the 1/34th or 1/67th part they had invested. So they didn't care if the person to whom they gave the loan defaulted. But things don't end there either. They wanted to maximise their fees. That is where the sub-prime mortgage lending comes in. Sub-prime are those basically those people who don't have the ability to pay back their loan. And mortgage loans are loans against a house or property. If a person who is rated sub-prime gets a loan, he will be charged a high rate of interest (more than normal). The investment banks charged the maximum fees for CDOs made from sub-prime mortgage loans. The reasoning behind that was if a sub-prime person actually paid back, then the return was higher because the interest on the loan was higher.
