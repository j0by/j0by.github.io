I identify as... tired. - Hannah Gadsby</p></blockquote> <p>These are lines from her live show, which later became a Netflix special, Nanette. When I first saw Nanette I was like, <em>WTF Capitalism, you are letting marginalized people have global audiences now? Is this goodbye?</em>. But my fears were uncalled for as recently after a 10 month hiatus, Louis C K returned to comedy and received a standing a ovation. Balance restored.</p> <p>Coming back to Nanette, it received wide praise and had about a million articles written about it. Everything seemed to talk about how ground breaking the show was, how this is a wake up call, how this will change comedy for ever. To quote one of the pieces:</p> <blockquote><p>Nanette has been making headlines for being difficult to watch, for making audiences uncomfortable. But what makes Nanette difficult to watch is what makes it hugely significant: Gadsby uses her identity — the reality of her physical presence, and the literal wear and tear of discrimination on her body — to deconstruct what it means to be a comedian who has been failed by comedy. Nanette’s uneasy relationship to comedy is a reflection of what it means to exist as a queer, butch woman (or in Gadsby’s phrasing, “gender not-normal”) in a social system that has always made you the punchline to the joke.</p></blockquote> <p>Hmm, very hard to put thoughts into words. I will stop now I guess.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
