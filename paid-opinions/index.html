But I really don't like Theo Walcott. But the good thing is Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager cares about my opinion and pays me for expressing them. Ya right, I wish. How good it would have been if people would pay me just to express my opinion. Things like that don't happen in the real world or does it?</p> <p>But it is possible in the Financial Services Industry. For an Industry that constantly redefines the boundary between the real and imaginary, that is light years ahead of its time, I guess anything is possible. The Financial Services Industry employs some of the &quot;brightest&quot; minds on the planet. And &quot;smart&quot; people come up with good ideas. Also unlike scientists who just sit around all day making theories, these guys go ahead and implement them. Oh and don't expect common people to understand these ideas. They are just too far behind in the evolutionary curve to even try.</p> <p>Just take the case of the credit rating agencies. Their job is to come up with their opinion on the probability of default of a security. These opinions are called ratings. But, what fun is there if you can't implement your idea. So let's look at how they implemented them, shall we?</p> <ol><li>They created laws that require every security, that has to be sold to the general public, to be rated. But thanks to the disproportionate lobbying power they enjoy, creating new laws is not that hard.</li> <li>The innovative methods they use to implement ratings are kept secret.</li> <li>Ask the owners of the security which you are rating to pay you (these are smart people who are adept at using <em>Chinese walls</em> both within their companies as well as their minds. So they are not prone to <em>conflicts of interest</em>).</li> <li>Make sure that they are not held accountable for the mistakes they make.</li></ol> <p>Yes, mistakes like the 2008 Financial crisis will happen. One of the causes of the crisis was the AAA rated derivative instruments called Collateralised Debt Obligations, defaulting. AAA rating means it will never default, but hello, these were opinions. Did they ask you to believe them?. Also, anyone with an iota of common sense will understand that the solution is not to hold them accountable. The European Union is drafting laws to make credit rating agencies accountable. When will they ever learn? More accountability means less risk. And less risk means less reward. And who would want to innovate without getting rewarded for it? There were some scientists like Albert Einstein, Madam Curie etc., who opposed patents and thereby the higher incentives lead to better innovation theory, but they weren't as forward thinking as <em>financial scientists</em>.</p> <p>What's they way forward then? Well for one, we need to provide a conducive environment for financial services companies to come up with innovations like <em>paid opinions</em>.
