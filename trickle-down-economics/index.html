What it says is that if you provide tax breaks and other incentives to businesses and people in the upper-income levels, it will benefit the poor by improving the economy as a whole (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>). The proponents of this theory say that governments should stop providing subsidies to the poor, and give tax cuts to the rich instead.</p> <p>Economist George Reisman, a proponent of trickle down economics has this to say:</p> <blockquote><p>Of course, many people will characterize the line of argument I have just given as the <em>trickle-down</em> theory. There is nothing trickle-down about it. There is only the fact that capital accumulation and economic progress depend on saving and innovation and that these in turn depend on the freedom to make high profits and accumulate great wealth. The only alternative to improvement for all, through economic progress, achieved in this way, is the futile attempt of some men to gain at the expense of others by means of looting and plundering. This, the <em>loot-and-plunder theory</em>, is the alternative advocated by the critics of the misnamed trickle-down theory.</p></blockquote> <p>There is research, to support as well as oppose this theory. Basically, if you have money, you can fund people with degrees to come up with a study that <em>finds</em> what you want. So going into the debate of whether the theory is right or wrong is futile. But I want to use this post to highlight a few things and leave it a that.</p> <ol><li>Providing tax breaks to businesses and the rich will improve the economy and uplift the poor. Yes, that seems about right. Oh wait, I missed a part - if I assume that the GDP per capita is the correct way to measure poverty. Hmm, that's quite an assumption. People from Kerala (a small state at the south-western tip of India) will tell you otherwise. Averages are a poor way to measure anything. The problem with assumptions is that your theory will work only if your assumptions are true. After invading Greece and receiving the submission of other key city-states, Philip II of Macedon sent a message to Sparta: <em>If I invade Laconia (Greek region containing Sparta) you will be destroyed, never to rise again.</em> The Spartans supposedly replied with a single word: <em>If</em>.</li> <li>The so called loot and plunder theory says that you should tax the rich and give the money thus earned to the poor. In other words providing the less fortunate people with subsidies. Hmm, in this case, the poor will get actual money. They won't have to wait for it to trickle down. And time value of money says that 100 rupees today is worth more than 100 rupees 2 days the down the line.</li> <li>Trickle down economists will tell you that the debate is between subsidy vs no subsidy. Again, not really true. Tax breaks and economic incentives are also subsidies. So the debate is actually between subsidy for the rich vs subsidy for the poor. Subsidy for the rich sounds so wrong. I guess that's why they prefer the terms tax cuts and economic incentives.</li></ol> <blockquote><p>So is trickle down economics right? Well its up to you to decide. Because it's about how reasonable you think the assumptions are, it's all about the <em>if</em>.</p></blockquote></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
