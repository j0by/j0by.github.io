As it happens in the movie, all of us will at some point, ask ourselves, &quot;What am I doing with my life?&quot; This, the inflection point, won't be like the countless other times, you aksed yourself that question, thought about it for sometime and then went back to your mundane life. When you actually hit inflection point, it will be an irriversible change. The question that remains is not whether you will hit inflection point, but when you will hit it? So, I am going to leave you with a few quotes, from three movies (one I used to like, two I still like). If you at this point would like to ask just like Evey from V for Vendetta :</p> <blockquote><p>Are you like a crazy person?</p></blockquote> <p>The only answer I have is crazy is simply a matter of perspective. So here are the quotes. The first one is from the Dark Knight (I used to like this movie, but don't really now for many reasons), Joker's monologue to Harvey:</p> <blockquote><p>Do I really look like a guy with a plan, Harvey? I don’t have a plan …The mob has plans. The cops have plans. You know what I am, Harvey? I am a dog chasing cars… I wouldn’t know what to do with one if I caught it. I just do things. I am just the wrench in the gears. I hate plans. Yours, theirs, everyone’s. Maroni has plans. Gordon has plans. Schemers trying to control their worlds. I am not a schemer. I show the schemer how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal, you know I am telling the truth. I just did what I do best. I took your plan and turned it on itself. Look what I have done to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets. Nobody panics when the expected people gets killed. Nobody panics when things go according to plan, even if the plan is horrifying. If I tell the press that tomorrow a gangbanger will get shot or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics. – because it’s all part of the plan. But when I say that one little old mayor will die, everybody lose their minds. Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I am an agent of chaos. And you know the thing about chaos Harvey? It is fair.</p></blockquote> <p>The second one is V's monologue from V for Vendetta:</p> <blockquote><p>I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine, the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration - whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, are celebrated with a nice holiday - I thought we could mark this November the fifth, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
Cruelty and injustice...intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable. But again, truth be told...if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War. Terror. Disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you and in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler. He promised you order. He promised you peace. And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.</p></blockquote> <p>And finally from Fight Club:</p> <blockquote><p>You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fucking khakis. You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. Listen up, maggots. You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Warning: If you are reading this then this warning is for you. Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don't you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can't think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all that claim it? Do you read everything you're supposed to read? Do you think every thing you're supposed to think? Buy what you're told to want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex. Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you're alive. If you don't claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned- Tyler.</p></blockquote> <p>And now, back to everyday life.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
