Yes, that’s not a typo. Because there is no Nobel Prize for Economics. As the Economist clearly says in their article (though they haven’t highlighted it) it is the Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel. It is the Swedish Central Bank (Sveriges Riksbank) that administers it and not the Nobel Foundation. And it is technically not a prize for Economics. It is awarded only to market economists. That is just one branch of economics. So basically it is a prize given by the Swedish Central bank to promote those people who do <em>research</em> into <em>science</em> that helps grow its business (If there is no market economy there is no need for a central bank). That is quite like tobacco companies funding research that comes out with the conclusion that there is no conclusive proof linking cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Or if you want a better example, Augusto Pinochet coming out with a prize called the Augusto Pinochet prize for excellence in tyranny in memory of Alfred Nobel and calling it the Nobel Prize for Dictators. Okay, that’s taking things a bit far, but you get what I mean.</p> <p>Now why would they want to specifically rebrand it the Nobel Prize? The Nobel Prize is awarded to people who have significantly contributed to cultural and/or scientific advances. So the whole idea is to create the façade that economics is a science. If you can put it on the same pedestal as a science like physics or chemistry, it becomes harder for common people to question it. To question a theory from physics you actually need to know about the theory. If you think that economics is a science then you will feel that you need to know more about it to question it, even though the economic theory might sound like bullshit to you (bullshit, not gibberish). And even if you learn those, most of them won’t make sense as they are mostly made up stuff. Because no economic theory has ever been able to correctly predict a particular outcome every time with the same accuracy. But real science can. Let’s take the case of relativity from physics. Most of you might think the effects of relativity can only be evident in some controlled experiment in a laboratory designed specifically for this purpose. Actually no. If you do not factor in relativity, any GPS you use will be able to predict your location to an accuracy of 52 kilometres only! You can say goodbye to navigating with Google maps. GPS’s work because light behaves the way Einstein predicted it would every single time. But no economist will be able to do something like that. And frankly I believe it’s a disgrace to real sciences that we keep referring to the economics prize as the Nobel Prize.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
