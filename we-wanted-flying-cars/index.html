One year back, I never thought I would do something like this. It feels oddly liberating to do something, that is in no way associated to finance. I don't have to wear formals to office. No more ties, no more shoes (that's right, I can wear flip flops to my office!). Oh and I almost forgot, I don't have to con people anymore.</p> <p>You might be thinking at this point - <em>just another guy complaining about finance, why did I even bother? Don't these people have a life?</em> Hmm, you are kind of right. I would never have had a stellar <em>career</em> if I had continued in finance. That is one of the reasons why I hate finance. But that is not the only reason. It stifles your imagination and doesn't let you dream. Ah, don't believe me? Just ask Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal, managing partner at Founder Fund and co-founder of Palantir, a firm specializing in data analysis.)</p> <p>In his new book, Zero to One, Thiel puts forward a few arguments along the same lines. Before I go any further let me say a few things. I am not a new age libertarian (otherwise known as a conservative) like him and would rather quote a silicon valley anarchist. But anything not coming from the mainstream can easily be discarded as a conspiracy theory. When it comes from the mainstream (like from Thiel) its harder to ignore. So I will go with Thiel's arguments.</p> <p>Thiel says that technology helps you go from zero to one, ie create something new. Whereas globalization helps you go from one to n (it just replicates existing stuff). And businesses like finance are a phenomenon of globalization. The thing with globalization is that it does not create any value. Finance is a classic example. The world we live in is one that is dominated by globalization. Ideally technology should dominate. Only then, can there be progress. Thiel says that a change in perception of people about the future also contributed to the dominance of globalization over technology. People now think more and more that the future is uncertain.</p> <p>Because they thought the future was uncertain, people tried to bring in certainty by doing routine, predictable things. They started preferring one to n over zero to one. Money became important because people thought of it as a means to tide over an uncertain future. And because of that finance as an industry gained prominence. Don't think for an instance that the finance guy has any clue about what to do with your money. Let's take an example. One of the basic assumptions of any market is that what happens in the future cannot be predicted. Your return from the market is calculated using models that hold this assumption true. You pay a finance guy to invest on your behalf, because you think he is able to predict the way in which the markets will move. So, either he has no clue about what he is doing or financial markets are fake (you can't contradict the basic assumption on which you base something, duh!). And ideally you wouldn't want to pay a clueless guy nor put your money in something that is fake.</p> <p>And sadly, people have now become kind of hardwired to favour one to n. It can easily be seen in their educational preferences. People are more and more preferring economics and management to engineering, science and arts. Deviating from the <em>certain</em> path is frowned upon. People once dreamt about flying cars becoming common. Now, nobody even dreams about it.</p> <p>But the good thing (or alarming thing) is that you have a choice. You can choose to be a mindless zombie, or you can start dreaming. Dreaming about the impossible (its not impossible, its just not been tried or done before) is the first step on the journey from zero to one.</p> <blockquote><p>And finance sucks.</p></blockquote></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
